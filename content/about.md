# $whoami

I am Cristian, a 25 year old spanish telematics engineering student.

I dualboot ArchLinux alongside Windows 11 (only for games xd). I like to be in constant learning and I am currently working on very different topics such as Frontend, Backend, DevOps, Sysadmin...

I also have a website for my server services you can check it out [here](https://server.crstian.me/)
